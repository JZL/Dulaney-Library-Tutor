#What is this?
This collection of scripts integrates with [google apps script](https://www.google.com/script/start/) to make a fully automated peer-tutoring system. It provides a website for inputting the information of tutors, 'tutees' (the student who is being tutored) which are organized in a central google sheet spreadsheet. From this data, it makes a third webpage to show possible matches between the tutors and 'tutees' and, after a match is selected, provides a document to printed to be put in the different homeroom teacher's mailboxes.
